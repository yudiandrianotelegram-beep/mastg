platform: ios
---

After installing @MASTG-TOOL-0137 on a jailbroken device, it is possible to attach the Safari developer tools to any `WKWebView` inside of applications installed from the App Store.

To activate the web inspection, follow these steps:

1. On the iOS device open the Settings app: Go to **Safari** -> **Advanced** and toggle on _Web Inspector_.
2. On the macOS device, open Safari: in the menu bar, go to **Safari** -> **Preferences** -> **Advanced** and enable _Show Develop menu in menu bar_.
3. Connect your iOS device to the macOS device and unlock it: the iOS device name should appear in the **Develop** menu.
4. (If not yet trusted) On macOS's Safari, go to the **Develop** menu, click on the **'iOS device name'** -> **Use for Development** and enable trust.

To open the web inspector and debug a WebView:

1. In iOS, open the app and navigate to any screen containing a WebView.
2. In macOS Safari, go to **Developer** -> **'iOS Device Name'** and you should see the name of the WebView-based context. Click on it to open the Web Inspector.

Now you're able to debug the WebView as you would with a regular web page on your desktop browser.

If everything is set up correctly, you can attach to any WebView with Safari:
