[gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) is a fast, open-source secrets scanner for files, directories, and git history. It detects hardcoded credentials such as API keys, tokens, and private keys using robust pattern rules and entropy heuristics.

Typical uses in mobile app testing include scanning dynamic analysis outputs (e.g., logs, detailed method traces, network traffic, app files) to quickly surface potential secrets written in cleartext, as well as auditing repositories of mobile projects.

Refer to the official documentation for installation and usage instructions.
