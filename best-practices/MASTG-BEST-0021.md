Secure exception and error handling in Android is about preventing leaks of sensitive information, managing failures gracefully, and ensuring that errors do not compromise security. User-facing error messages should remain generic, while controlled logging is reserved for developers. The [OWASP DevGuide](https://devguide.owasp.org/en/12-appendices/01-implementation-dos-donts/06-exception-error-handling/) reinforces these principles with a focus on not disclosing internal details to end users, sanitizing logs, and ensuring secure failure modes that do not weaken authentication or authorization.

- **Avoid leaking sensitive information**: Error messages shown to users should be generic and not reveal internal details. Logs should be sanitized to remove sensitive data and restricted to authorized personnel. The official [Log Info Disclosure](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/log-info-disclosure) guidance warns against including sensitive data or stack traces in production logs and recommends sanitization and reduced verbosity.
- **Fail securely**: Exceptions must not weaken security controls. Any failure in security checks should result in a **deny** outcome, blocking the action rather than allowing weaker assumptions or insecure fallbacks. Security mechanisms should default to denying access until explicitly granted, since fail-open paths are a common attack vector.
- **Validate strictly and abort on errors**: Unexpected formats or values should be treated as errors. Do not continue in a partially verified state. For example, if a network call succeeds at the transport layer but fails validation at the application layer, processing must stop.
