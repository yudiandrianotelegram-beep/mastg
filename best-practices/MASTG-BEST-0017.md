`SurfaceView` creates a separate surface that is not protected by `FLAG_SECURE` even if the containing window has it set. To protect content in a `SurfaceView`, use [`setSecure(true)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceView#setSecure(boolean)) before the surface view's containing window is attached to the window manager.
