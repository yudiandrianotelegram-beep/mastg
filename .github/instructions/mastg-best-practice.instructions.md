## Best Practices

Best practices must be linked to MASTG tests using the  `best-practices:` key.

They must have official references which may include the MASTG as long as it contains further references to e.g. Google/Apple docs or other official sources.

Best Practices should contain:

* what's the recommendation
* why is that good
* any caveats or considerations (e.g. "it's good to have it but remember it can be bypassed this way", etc.)
